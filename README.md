Old OpenXIP&trade; Documents
============================

This repository holds documents from earlier releases for the
XIP&trade; and AVT&trade; projects, which have now been combined 
into the OpenXIP&trade; project.  In other words, OpenXIP&trade; was built
starting with the content from the original XIP&trade; and AVT&trade projects
that were sponsored by NCI as part of their caBIG&reg; initiative.
Both XIP&trade; and AVT&trade; have evolved since then, and are now
developed independent of NCI.  The documentation in this repository
is provided primarily for historic purposes, and may not reflect the
current state of the software.

Public mirrors of the various repositories for the OpenXIP 
project can be found at <https://github.com/OpenXIP>.
