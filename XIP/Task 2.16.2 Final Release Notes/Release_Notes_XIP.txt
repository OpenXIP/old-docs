                      1.0 {Product} Introduction
================================================================

This document contains the release notes for the eXtensible Imaging 
Platform (XIP) project Release 1.0, Version 02-04-2008.  This version 
is for beta testing, integration with other projects, and for 
further development.

The XIP Application Libraries support rapidly building imaging and 
visualization applications. The modules in the XIP Application 
Libraries follow the Open Inventor(tm) interface paradigm, and 
include not only the Open Inventor functions, but also functions 
from the VTK and ITK toolkits, along with custom functions to 
support DICOM file handling, graphical overlays commonly used in 
medical imaging, hardware accelerated rendering and processing, 
among other things.  

The XIP Builder tool allows a developer to graphically create scene 
graphs of objects available in the XIP Application Libraries, as well 
as other properly formed libraries of objects that follow the 
Open Inventor interface. 

This version of this release of XIP has not been reviewed for
classification into a caBIG compatibility level.  The intention 
of this release of the XIP project is to support caBIG compatibility 
level silver through the use of the caBIG IVI Middleware project.

================================================================
                      2.0 Release History
================================================================
   

This version is leading to the first release of the XIP project, 
and is the fourth version distributed.


================================================================
                      3.0 New Features and Updates
================================================================

The XIP library in this version of the release includes:    

    - The base Open Inventor objects
    - The base ITK library objects
    - The base VTK library objects
    - The base XIP rendering (HW accelerated) and MPR objects
    - The base XIP overlay and markup objects
    - The base XIP DICOM file access objects
    - The core XIP objects
    - The core XIP objects for accessing OpenGL 2.0 features, including
      the texture memory and GLSL-compatible shaders

This version of the release includes the binaries for the XIP
Builder Tool being created by Siemens Corporate Research.  The
XIP Builder Tool greatly simplifies the creation of scene graphs
and pipelines.

The XIP host in this version of the release includes:    

    - Base classes for the DICOM WG-23 Application Hosting interfaces 
         (file-based method, as defined in June 2007).
    - Logic to manage the launching and control of multiple applications
         through the DICOM WG-23 Application Hosting interfaces
    - Access to local files
    - Access to DICOM Storage SCPs
    - Access to the caGrid through the caBIG IVI Middleware
    - User authentication (login) through caGrid security mechanisms, 
         provided through the caBIG IVI Middleware

This version of the release includes the following sample applications: 

    - A test application for checking the functionality of the 
         DICOM WG-23 Application Hosting interfaces.
    - A simple “Hello Cone” application illustrating the simple use 
         of the XIP libraries in a Java-based XIP Application.
    - A sample application that is a start at performing the follow-up 
      Adjudication use case.  This sample application displays and 
      scrolls through a pair of images sets (e.g. the prior and current 
      studies) either locked or unlocked, and allows the user to make 
      linear measures (e.g. of the longest axis).  The application also 
      includes the start of a GUI for viewing AIM annotations made by 
      other users, and for creating an adjudicated ‘consensus’ AIM 
      annotation as output.  However, the AIM tools for reading and 
      creating AIM annotations have not been incorporated into this
      application.  

================================================================
                      4.0 Bug fixes Since Last Release
================================================================


Given that this is the first publically available version that 
is being widely distributed, there are no bug reports in the 
tracking system.
   
  
================================================================
                     5.0 Known Issues Not Yet Fixed
================================================================

    - Linux makefiles can be created using the CMake utility.
      However, the library builds for Linux have not been fully
      debugged and tested, hence are not yet included.
    - Source for the XIP Builder tool is not yet included.


================================================================
                     6.0 Notes
================================================================

The build scripts expect that the OIV_PATH environment variable points 
to the top level directory of the Open Inventor(tm) installation.

The build scripts needs an installation of ITK include files and 
libraries in order to build.  The build scripts expects that the 
ITK_PATH environment variable points to the top level directory 
of the ITK installation in order to build.

The build scripts expect that the FT2_PATH environment variable points 
to the top level directory of the FT2 installation in order to build.
