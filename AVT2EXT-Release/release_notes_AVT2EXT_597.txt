Introduction
---------------------------

The Algorithm Validation Toolkit (AVT) provides tools to 
support medical image measurement validation research.  The 
goal of AVT is to provide the caBIG community with sharable
tools to support their measurement research, so that when a 
research study is published, and the image data used in it is
released on caGrid, the support software can also be released,
so that another researcher can more readily replicate the
experiment and/or extend it.

AVT provides tools to:
* Create gold standard markups
* Carry out interactive markup experiments under tightly
  controlled conditions
* Carry out algorithmic markup experiments on large collections
  of images
* Conduct exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing on
  large collections of markups

Known Issues/Defects
------------------------

* Limited set of screen sizes tested.  Sizes below 1280x1024 or above 1600x1200 sometimes fail.
* Data-dependent statistics server crashes.
* Contour editor truncates coordinates instead of rounding.
* Contour cannot handle non-contiguous region of interest.
* Image viewing panes do not refresh after certain actions for which they should refresh.
* Histogram plot sometimes gives wrong vertical scale.
* AE slowed down by trace outputs.
* Spaces in folder names, for installation or data, cause failures.
* Not tested on Windows 7
